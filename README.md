# codeYeTi-cti

`codeYeTi-cti` is an incomplete clone of [EUTW PvP Warfare](https://eutw.net) with combat more similar to that of [Olympus Altis Life](https://olympus-entertainment.com).

# Compilation

You will need `make`, and the `m4` macro processor to compile the UI header config files. Once you are in an environment with those tools, simply run `make` to generate the required files before packaging or firing up the mission.

# Status

This project is a learning project aimed at learning the ArmA ecosystem, language and engine. There are some anti-patterns left from not knowing what to do originally, and it is in great flux. This is by no means a finished product, and is *entirely missing* the UI for a vehicle shop. Please do **not** try to run this as a playable game mode, though contributions to help get development to a finished and stable state are more than welcome.
